        <h1>Steven Doty</h1>
        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>
          After many years of learning Electrical Engineering, I volunteered in India, bathed elephants in Cambodia, and witnessed various other cultures in Vietnam, Italy, London, and Sri Lanka.
          My career experiences range from fine finish woodworking to being a lifeguard, from being a server at a restaurant to being a ranch hand.
          Over the years I have learned many things and most recently I learned Web Development.
          It started as a hobby, turned into a passion, and now I'm choosing to make it a career.
